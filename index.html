						<p>Hi! I'm Zoe. Originally from Fleet, Hampshire I've recently moved to Manchester. I currently work as Optimisation Designer at Belron International. I have always had an interest in techology and IT whilst being in school but it wasn't until collage where I found I had a passion for designing and making websites. From there I went to study Web Design and Development at Southampton Solent University achieving a 2:1 with honours.</p>
						
						<p>As a Optimisation Designer at Belron International I work with 12 business units engaging and managing numerous stakeholders. Within VAPS (Value Added Products &amp; Services) I increase online attachment rate of additional products without decreasing conversion via A/B testing. Within the conversion workstream I find pain points within the Online booking funnels (OLB) and create solutions to help our customers complete their online journey. </p>
					
						<p>Within my spare time I volunteer as a Guide Leader for Girl Guides. I play videogames with Overwatch being my game of choice. I also enjoy crafts there isn't one I haven't tried!</p>

					<h1>Experience</h1>
					<button class="collapsible">Junior Web Designer | CV-Library</button>
					<div class="content">
						<p>A website design role within the CV-Library (CVL) online design team, this is a varied role split between both design and coding work. I carry out regular tasks where I maintain the CVL website, admin pages; I regularly design and hand code products for our clients these include emails, premium profiles and premium job adverts.</p>

						<p>The creative half of my role has me using the Adobe create cloud suite daily, I use a range of programs including XD, Photoshop, InDesign and illustrator. Using XD, I mock-up all client products before sending them off for approval, should the client have any changes or amendments I implement them before making their product live. In Photoshop I manipulate and compose new images along with creating informative GIFs. I create and edit job specifications and forms using InDesign that are sent out to both potential employees and current employees, this was one of the additional tasks I have picked up whilst working at CVL. In the second half of my role, I use HTML and CSS to carry out essential maintenance to the CVL website. I regularly update our internal admin pages ensuring all floorplans are up to date. I hand code all client products including emails and carry out testing beforehand to ensure the layout is appropriate and accessible on all devices. I also create each month’s staff newsletter this is sent out to all company offices and employees, which I have recently re-designed and re-coded this to have a modern and clean look as well as being fully responsive. Another important task I have already carried out was to update a number of pages on the CVL website ensuring they too were fully responsive and complied with the internal design system.</p>

I worked systematically from multiple lists to verify numerous accounts in order to meet and excel daily targets. This was recorded using a number of Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets to keep track of productivity. I regularly made outbound phones calls to inform and talk suppliers through their profile updates. I would also support the helpdesk by taking incoming calls and dealing with customer queries or transferring the caller to the appropriate department within the office.</p>
